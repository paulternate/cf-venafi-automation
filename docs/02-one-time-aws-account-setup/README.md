# 02. One-Time AWS Account Setup

## What's this all about?

Security teams need to strike a balance between granting enough privilege for staff to do the job, whilst staying secure.
Privilege escalation risks in AWS are contained by limiting what you're allowed to do, particularly with the Identity and Access Management (IAM) service.
Such limits can impact the standard workflow used when creating and deploying Lambda functions.
We can address this in each AWS account by pre-configuring an IAM Role for Lambda to use, but someone with elevated rights will need to apply the fix.

## What do I need to do?

**Answer: probably nothing.**

If you're using a Venafi/Jetstack AWS account today then the fix has likely been applied already so the following action is **not required** and you can move straight on with the [first exercise](../03-tlspc-application-automation/README.md).

For anyone else, assuming you have the elevated rights required in your AWS account, you will need to apply this fix via CloudFormation.

If you're not sure, please consult your instructor.

## The Venafi One-Time AWS Setup Template

| Type | Description | S3 | Source |
| - | - | - | - |
| Template | Creates an IAM Role named VenafiLambdaBasicExecutionRole and an S3 bucket named VenafiTLSPCCertificates-${AWS::AccountID}. VenafiLambdaBasicExecutionRole is used by Lambda Functions to provide them with the ability to send logs to CloudWatch and interact with the S3 service for storage | https://venafi-ecosystem.s3.amazonaws.com/tlspc/templates/venafi-one-time-setup.yaml | [View](../../tlspc/templates/venafi-one-time-setup.yaml) |

<!-- if this template get any more complicated (likely) we may need a resource column in the above table -->

## Creating your Stack

The following steps will enable Lambda Functions in the exercises to be successfully created.

- Navigate to https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home
- Click on "Create stack", then click "With new resources (standard)"
- On the "Create stack" page, under "Specify template", set "Amazon S3 URL" to `https://venafi-ecosystem.s3.amazonaws.com/tlspc/templates/venafi-cfn-setup.yaml`, then click "Next"
- On the "Specify stack details" page, set "Stack name" to something appropriate, like, `venafi-cfn-setup`, then click "Next"
- Scroll to the foot of the "Configure stack options" page, then click "Next"
- Scroll to the foot of the "Review" page, check âœ… the "Capabilities" checkbox and finally click "Submit"

After ~30 secs, the Stack will reach a "Status" of "CREATE_COMPLETE".
You will now be able to continue with the exercises in this workshop.

NOTE: You ran the Template in the "us-east-1" region.
For the purpose of this exercise, and to keep a long story short, it's probably best just to stick with this arrangement!

NOTE: To get the most benefit from these exercises, we recommend the use of Versioned S3 Buckets. If the Stacks you create in the exercise use the Bucket created by this One-Time Stack, Versioning is enabled for you.

<!-- if we need to regionalize these buckets (and setup replication) then we should do so with another template (or use CDK) in a manner similar to the "venafi-ecosystem" buckets -->
